--> Modern Routers 

    You must think that in our homes,offices we generally see routers and not 
    switch why ? 
    Modern routers have switch , router and WAC (wireless access control)
    combined.
    In modern routers , router is attached/connected with switch and switch is 
    attached/connected with WAC. 

    WAC : it stands for wireless access control. 
    The WAC helps computers , laptops and other devices to connect with the
    switch without cables via wifi. 

    Our devices connects to the router via wifi through WAC.The WAC is connected
    to the switch. 

    router --> switch <-- WAC (Wireless Access Control)

    Note : If we are connecting to the router via cable than we are connecting
    with the switch.But if we are connecting to the router via wifi or wireless
    than we connect with the WAC.The WAC is connected to the switch physically 
    internally. 
    The router is also connected to the switch pyhsically internally. 

    concept ki barsaat hogyi.

    Modern day routers contains router , switch and WAC connected together which
    is called as router.
