------------------------------------- IP Address -----------------------------------

--> What is IP address ? 
    IP address stands for internet protocol. 
    It is the temporary address of the computer on the internet given by ISP.
    The IP address is the address of the machine/computer on the internet.
    The IP address helps to identify the computer on the internet.
    It is the address of the machine that is connected to the internet.

    To send data from A to B , we need the IP address , Mac address and Port number
    of A as well as B. 

    Structure of a message 

    SIP | SMAC | SPORT | Data/Request | RIP | RMAC | RPORT

    SIP : sender IP address
    SMAC : sender MAC address
    SPORT : sender Port number
    Data/Request : Data you want to send or any request. 
    RIP : receiver IP address. 
    RMAC : receiver MAC address. 
    RPORT : receiver PORT number. 

    IP address is simply the address of the computer on the internet. 

    Note : When we connect to the internet , than a temporary IP address is given to 
    our device and when we disconnect from the internet than that IP address is taken 
    from us.This happens all the time. 
    IP address is not permanent address.It is the temporary address. 
    Once you disconnect from the internet than your IP address can also allocate
    to a different device. 

    Suppose x IP address is given to A when A is connected to the internet.When A 
    disconnects from the internet than x IP address is taken from it.The x can be
    given to another device B as well.Same IP address cannot be given to multiple
    devices at the same time.

--> Who gives IP address to our device ? 
    ISP (Interet Service Provider) gives a temporary IP address to our device each
    time when we connect to the internet.
    ISP are those that provides internet services like jio , airtel etc. 

    Note : When we on the internet than ISP provides a temporary IP address for 
    our device and when we disconnect from the internet than ISP takes back that
    IP address from us.IP address is very dynamic.It is not permanent address and it
    is not the same.It changes everytime when we on/connect to the internet.
