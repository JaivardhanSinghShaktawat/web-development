# LAN Switch And Router

## Local Area Network And Switch

## Switch

- Switch is used to create a local area network.
- Switch is used to create a connection between all the computers.
- it is a central device through which all the computers are connected.
- All the computers connects with the switch via a wire/ethernet.

If A computer wants to communicate/send data to B computer than A will send the data to switch.Switch will than send the data to the B computer.
Similarly , if B wants to communicate with A or some other computer than B will send the data to the switch and switch will send the data to the A or some other computer.

## Advantage of switch

1. We can connect more computers easily.It is more scalable.
2. It saves wires as we don't have to connect all the computers to each other.

## LAN

it s a local area network where multiple devices are connected to each other via a single entity which is switch.All the computers are connected to a single device which is switch.

## Router

it is a device that is used to connect different LAN networks together.
Router is used to route the data.
It's main task is to connect different local area networks together.
Each LAN should have a router.Both the routers are connected together via a wire as well as both the routers are connected to their LAN switch as well.

**c1 --> switch --- router1 ----- router2 ---- switch --> c2**

routers are connected to switch as well as to another router.

Internet : combining all the local networs/local area networks via routers is called as internet.

**Internet :** it is combination of all the different local networks connected
together via routers.

We can connect to the routers via using cable or wifi.
The cable is directly connected to the switch and the switch is connected to the router in modern world.

If you want to connect via wifi than the WAC connects the phone/device to the switch and WAC is connected to the switch and switch is connected to the router.

The optic fibre cables connects the different country together.

**Note :** All the devices are connected with each other through optic fibre cables and in countries different cities and states are connected via wires and cables.
The local area networks are connected together via routers.
The local computers are connected together via switch.

## How data is send from mobile ?

We send and receive data from mobile to the tower.The tower has cables which is present underground and the data travel through that underground cables.
This is how internet works.
