# IP Address

## What is IP address ?

- IP address stands for internet protocol.
- It is the temporary address of the computer on the internet given by ISP.

To send data from A to B and vice versa , we need the IP address , Mac address and Port number of A as well as B.

**Note :** Instead of typing the complete domain name or url , we can also type the IP address of the server in browser and can make request to the server.

IP address is simply the address of the computer on the internet.

**Note :** When we connect to the internet , than a temporary IP address is given to
our device and when we disconnect from the internet than that IP address is taken
from us.This happens all the time.
The allocation and deallocation of IP address to our device is done by ISP.
IP address is not permanent address.It is the temporary address.
Once you disconnect from the internet than your IP address can also allocate to a different device.

Suppose x IP address is given to A when A is connected to the internet.When A
disconnects from the internet than x IP address is taken back from it.The x can be
given to another device B as well.Same IP address cannot be given to multiple
devices at the same time.

## Who gives IP address to our device ?

ISP (Interet Service Provider) gives a temporary IP address to our device each time when we connect to the internet and when we disconnect from the internet than this IP address is taken back by ISP.
ISP are those that provides internet services like jio , airtel etc.

**Note :** When we on the internet than ISP provides a temporary IP address for our device and when we disconnect from the internet than ISP takes back that IP address from us.IP address is very dynamic.It is not permanent address and it is not the same.It changes everytime when we on/connect to the internet.

ISP can give the same IP address to different devices but not at the same time.ISP changes rapidly when we connect to the internet.
