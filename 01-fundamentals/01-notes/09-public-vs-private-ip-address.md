# Public Vs Private IP Address

**Note :** If you are connected via wifi than most of the people IP address will be the same.IP address are unique so how is it possible even ? It is possible because of public and private IP address.

## Types Of IP Address

**Private IP Address :** They are reserved IP address.
So most of the time when you connect your laptop with phone than your IP address will be almost same and it's range will be 3rd one that is described below.
But if you go to whatismyipaddress.com website than it will show different IP address but why ?
whatismyipaddress shows your router IP address when you are connect with a wifi.

It is divided into three parts -

1. used by large corporates (10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)
2. used by medium sized networks (172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255)
3. most common for home networks (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255)

The above 3 different IP address range can be unique in a local area network but the same IP address can be used by other computer in a different local area network.

If a computer is using any IP address of the above 3 described range in a local area network than the same IP address can also be used by other computer in a different local area network.

Public IP Address : it is the IP address of your router.
it is unique globally.

**Note :** Always remember , whenever we request something than the request goes through the router and with that request the IP address of the router goes and not our private IP address.The router IP address is public globally.

## Why request pass through the router ?

It is because router connects one local network with other local network.
Without router it will be difficult to connect different local networks.
When a computer in a local network request something from other local
network than the request pass through the router and with that request
the IP address of the router is shared and not the private IP address of
the computer.

**Private IP address :** It is the IP address of the computer connected to switch in a local area network.
It is unique within the local area network.
They are unique within the local network.
Same private IP address can be used by more than 1 computers at the same time in different local area networks.But routers cannot use same IP address at the same time.

**Public IP address :** It is the IP address of the router which is unique globally.
It is unique globally.
it is public IP address which is global.
Public IP addresses are unique globally.

## Why Private IP addresses are not shared with the request/response/data ?

Private IP addresses are unique within the local area networks and not globally.
More than one computer can have same IP address at the same time in different local networks.But router have public IP address which is unique globally.
So with the data/request/response public IP address of router is shared.
If we share Private IP address with the request than the data won't be able to send to the correct device.

## Why this concept of Private IP address came into picture ?

Earlier when we had IPV4 IP address system than we were able to give IP address to only 4.3 billion devices only at the same time.But there were many devices.To solve this problem , private IP address came into picture which allows multiple computers to use the same IP address at the same time in different local area networks.Only the router have unique IP address.

Private IP address is unique within the local network but not globally.
Public IP address is unique globally.Routers have Public IP address.
