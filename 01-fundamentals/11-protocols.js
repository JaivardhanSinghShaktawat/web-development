----------------------------- Protocols And Fundamentals --------------------------

--> What are protocols ? 
    A protocol is a set of rules.

--> What is HTTP/HTTPS ? 
    HTTP/HTTPS are communication protocol that is used for communication between 
    client and the server.

    the server.

    HTTP : HyperText Transfer Protocol
    HTTPS : HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTP + TLS/SSL Certificate)

    HTTPS : It is more secure.Here the data is first encryted and than shared/transfer 
    between client and the server. 

    Note : During production always use HTTPS encrypted server.
    It encrypts the data before sharing so that no one can read the data between 
    client and the server.

    FTP and SSH protocols are used to share the files
    SMTP protocols are used in mails.
    HTTP/HTTPS are used in web.

    Anyone can read the data between client and server if you are using http 
    protocol.

    In HTTPS , data is encrypted and than shared between client and the server. 
    It is more secure. 
    Here data is first encrypted before sending and than send.The data is then
    decrypted in the receiver side.  

--> What is SSH protocol ? 
    SSH stands for secure shell protocol.It's a file transfer protocol that is used for
    transfering/sharing the files over an unsecured network.
