-------------------------------- LAN Switch And Router -----------------------------

--> Local Area Network And Switch 

    Switch : it is a central device through which all the computers are connected.
    All the computers connects with the switch vai a wire/ethernet. 

    If A computer wants to communicate/send data to B computer than A will send
    the data to switch.Switch will than send the data to the B computer. 
    Similarly , if B wants to communicate with A or some other computer than B 
    will send the data to the switch and switch will send the data to the A or
    some other computer. 

    Advantage of switch 

    We can connect more computers easily.It is more scalable. 
    It saves wires as we don't have to connect all the computers to each other. 

    Disadvantage of switch 

    single point of failure : it means if switch fails than no one can communicate
    with each other. 

    LAN : it s a local area network where multiple devices are connected to each
    other via a single entity which is switch.All the computers are connected
    to a single device which is switch. 

--> Router : it is used to connect different LAN networks together. 
    Router is used to route the data. 
    It's main task is to connect different local area networks together. 
    Each LAN should have a router.Both the routers are connected together via
    a wire as well as both the routers are connected to their LAN switch as well.

    routers are connected to switch as well as another router. 
    Internet : combining all the local networs/local area networks via routers
    is called as internet. 

--> Go to submarinecablesmap website to see the different cables that creates 
    internet. 

    The optic fibre cables connects the different country together.
    In each country , there are multiple cables that connects local area network. 
    The local area networks are connected together via routers. 
    The local computers are connected together via switch.

--> How data is send from mobile ? 
    We send and receive data from mobile to the tower.The tower has cables which is 
    present underground and the data travel through that underground cables. 
    This is how internet works.
